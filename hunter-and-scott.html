        I had a late arrival wedding gift in the form of a $50 gift card. My wife convinced me to buy something for me. So, a bottle of whiskey it was. I had no preconceived notion of what I wanted. I went to the ABC store with no plan other than to use most of the $50 granted to me, and perhaps to try something new. My first thought was a Japanese whisky, as I’ve never had one to my knowledge. But I couldn’t find one. I paced the whiskey aisle about 4 to 5 times until the Hunter & Scott caught my eye for reasons unknown to me. But on the label it read “product of Virginia” and I thought that was perfect. I would love nothing more than to find a spirit from my home state that I love.

          The Hunter & Scott is one of the choices from Reservoir Distillery located in Richmond, Virginia. I did my undergrad in RVA at VCU so I am very familiar with the city, albeit I had never heard of Reservoir. Breweries were the big thing back then. I wouldn’t have known what a distillery was anyway. Distilled water? That sounds boring. Now, of course, I wish I would have known about it. Good thing I only stay about 90 minutes away as I will certainly be making a near future visit.

          Reservoir distillery opened back in 2008 I believe. All of their grains are grown right here in Virginia So you are quite literally getting a taste of Virginia with each sip, and I love that. What intrigues me most about the distillery is a few bottles they offer. Their wheat, bourbon, and rye bottles are respectively 100% mash bills. The wheat is 100% wheat, bourbon 100% corn, rye 100% rye. So if you want a sense of what unique characteristics each grain has to offer in a whiskey, I can’t think of a better way to do it. I definitely plan to try those options. The Hunter & Scott bourbon runs a mash bill of 69% corn, 14% wheat, 14% rye, and 3% barley. All grains are from VA, and the barrels from Kentucky, Indiana, and even some Virginian white oak.

        The whiskey comes off as very balanced. Nothing is overpowering. The vanilla is what jumps out the most to me, and that is also the note my nose is most attuned to at the moment. It’s pretty full but not robust. Fantastic to sip neat. I’ll have to give it a try in a cocktail.

        This feels like a novelty bottle purchase. So I love it as my first one. The batch and bottle number are even handwritten on the bottle to make it feel more special. I can’t wait to visit the folks up there.
