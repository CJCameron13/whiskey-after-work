      <p>
        I’m pretty sure the first whiskey I ever had was Fireball, probably 2012. Let my admission of that fact to start this blog go to show that I do not intend to take myself too seriously along this journey. I don’t want to be “that guy”, I just want to be myself. Myself being someone that takes interest in learning deeply about the things he enjoys. Being that I had my first sip of whiskey twelve years ago, I am nowhere near new to enjoying the water of life. However I am starting fresh in learning to truly experience whiskey for what it is. I don’t intend to be a critic of any whiskey that I taste and talk about. I’m not here to convince you of what the objectively “best” bottle is. Quality exists, and is important, however taste will always be subjective. If Fireball tastes like rain from heaven to you, then good on you. Who am I to tell you otherwise? What I do want to accomplish here is to give rich detail about my experiences with different bottles, what I think about them, and what I noticed/sensed. You can decide for yourself whether it’s something you’d like to try. My hope is that the longer I do this the more discerning my descriptions will become, and instead of preaching what the best whiskey is, I can figure out what may be the best whiskey for you after getting to know you a bit. And if anything, it’s something to take interest in and immerse myself in. Hopefully, I get to share that interest with many folks along the way.
