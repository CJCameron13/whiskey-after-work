      <h1>The First Tasting</h1>

        I wanted to begin by tasting three distinct types of whiskey. At this stage I want to be able to comfortably discern between different whiskey types, and sus out their unique characteristics. I went with a newly purchased bottle, Woodford Reserve Kentucky Straight bourbon, and two already on my shelf, Johnnie Walker Red Label Blended Scotch, and Crown Royal Northern Harvest Rye. So that’s bourbon, scotch, and rye. I can honestly say I’ve consumed the most bourbon over the years. I live in the States where it’s made and seems to be in abundance in comparison to the others. A good old fashioned is one of my favorite drinks and my typical go-to whiskey base is a bourbon. Rye, I don’t often drink neat. Not because I don’t like it, but since I generally associate ryes with a manhattan, that is the primary context in which I would choose to drink a rye. I have friends that really into scotch, and introduced me to it if I remember correctly. Scotch, I have to be in the mood for. It’s taste leans bitter to me. Bourbon and rye I can find myself consuming pretty quickly. While scotch is a true sipper. Anyway, here are my initial thoughts of each:

          <h2>Woodford (bourbon)</h2>
          <p>
            The bourbon is immediately sweeter on the nose, and my taste buds agreed. I figured notes of vanilla. The Woodford distiller claims that the spirit has over 200 detectable tasting notes. I’d like to see someone pick out all 200, until then I’m suspicious. Either way, I’ll be happy with the one I found. And since there’s 200, vanilla is bound to be one of them right? Another thing I noted was a more syrupy feel on the tongue. Not as thick as actual syrup, but enough to contribute to the sense of sweetness.

          <h2>Johnnie Walker Red Label (scotch)</h2>
          <p>
            The scotch is a lot sharper on the nose than the bourbon. From what I’ve already experienced, scotch is certainly the most distinct of the three. To me, it really dominates the palate. It’s almost medicinal. It has a more oily feel compared to the bourbon. Also more spicy than sweet.

          <h2>Crown Royal (rye)</h2>
          <p>
            What jumped out most to me was the somewhat grassy and earthy taste. Tastes like outside, but in a good way. It was spicy, but less so than the scotch. I initially stated that it smelled “bright”. I can’t yet articulate what that really means, but I’m trying to authentically describe the experience.

      <p>
        In a blind taste test I like to think that I would most definitely be able to pick out the scotch.  And I hope I would be able to pick up on the sweetness of the bourbon, leaving the rye. Which is the goal! My descriptions of unique characteristics probably wouldn’t land me with the whiskey experts, but I think we’re off to a great start.
