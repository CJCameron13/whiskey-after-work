# Whiskey After Work
The primary purpose of this project is for strong portfolio material. The idea came about from wanting to become a more informed whiskey enthusiast. My hope is that this project will evolve over time. I do want to function beyond portfolio material and have real-world purpose. At current it features a simple blog, other ideas I have are to add profiles of individual whiskeys, and a feature that can recommend bottles based on a user's stated preferences.
